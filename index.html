            <p>Zurich is Switzerland's largest city, a major transportation hub, and a top starting point for travelers. The city lies
                at the northwestern end of Lake Zurich astride the river Limmat. Beyond its buttoned-up façade, this affluent banking
                capital boasts a rich line-up of cultural treasures.</p>

            <p>Nestled on a strip of land between two glassy lakes, Interlaken looks like a postcard brought to life. The enchanting
                resort town has been a popular vacation destination for centuries, giving tourists a home base to explore the Bernese
                Oberland. Visit in the spring or summer to take in the striking sight of the town's lush gardens blooming with the
                snow-dusted Eiger, Jungfrau, and Mönch towering in the background.</p>

            <p>Since 1912, tourists have been making their way to the fairytale-like village of Grindelwald for an excursion to the Top
                of Europe (also known as Jungfraujoch). As its name suggests, it's the highest train station in Europe.</p>

            <p>The Matterhorn, Switzerland's iconic pointed peak is one of the highest mountains in the Alps. On the border with Italy,
                this legendary peak rises to 4,478 meters, and its four steep faces lie in the direction of the compass points. The
                first summiting in 1865 ended tragically when four climbers fell to their death during the descent. Today, thousands of
                experienced climbers come here each summer.</p>
